# 🌤️ CloudPlayground

### 🧠 What is CloudPlayground?

**CloudPlayground** — a summer (and beyond) project — is a real-world learning sandbox that serves both as a **school-year portfolio** and a **personal AI development lab**. Led by two teenagers and guided by their father, the project is a hands-on journey into:

- 🚀 **Cloud infrastructure** concepts (including virtualization and deployment)  
- 🤖 **AI model** exploration and experimentation  
- 🎨 **Web design and development**  
- 👨‍👩‍👦 **Git-based collaboration** with code reviews and version control

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a foundational understanding of how cloud systems and the internet work  
- Create a small but functional web-based application (the "playground")  
- Develop a working prototype for experimenting with simple AI models  
- Gain experience with real-world tools: Git, GitHub, Figma, Notion, Trello  
- Learn project planning, time management, and team collaboration  
- Prepare a year-end digital project presentation (Moses)  
- Encourage creativity, curiosity, and a love for building
- Have fun
